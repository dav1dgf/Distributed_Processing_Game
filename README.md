# üéÆ Two-Robot Arena

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)](#)

A 2D local/Wi-Fi multiplayer shooter built in Unity. Two robots‚Äî**Red** vs **Blue**‚Äîface off in a compact arena, blasting each other until one remains.

## üõ†Ô∏è Concurrent Programming Methods

Below is an overview of the primary concurrency techniques and APIs used in this project:

| Context     | Language / API                 | Purpose                                                                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Client**  | **C# `async` / `await`**       | - Perform non-blocking network I/O (`ConnectAsync`, `ReadAsync`)                              |
|             | **C# `Task.Delay()`**             | - Retry logic for reconnecting every 500 ms without freezing the main game loop               |
|             | **C# `Queue<string>`**            | - Buffer incoming messages safely for processing on Unity‚Äôs main thread                       |
|             | **C# `OnApplicationQuit()`**      | - Gracefully close sockets/streams when the application exits                                |
| **Server**  | **Python `threading.Thread`**  | - Handle each client connection in its own parallel thread                                   |
|             | **Python `threading.Lock`**    | - Protect shared data structures (`players` dict) from race conditions                       |
|             | **Python `threading.Barrier`** | - Synchronize both player threads at key phases (assignment, game start, turn transitions)   |
|             | **Python `socket.recv/send`**| - Perform network I/O on worker threads without impacting other threads                      |
|             | **Python `signal.signal(SIGINT,‚Ä¶)`**  | - Catch Ctrl+C to trigger a clean, orderly server shutdown                                   |

### How it works in practice

1. **Unity Client**  
   - `Start()` is marked `async` and uses `await` to connect and then listens for server messages with `await stream.ReadAsync()`.  
   - All network calls are non-blocking, so Unity‚Äôs Update loop remains smooth and unblocked.

2. **Python Server**  
   - The main thread accepts TCP connections and spawns a new `threading.Thread` for each client.  
   - Inside each `handle_client` thread, `Barrier.wait()` calls ensure both clients stay in sync before the game starts and before each turn.  
   - `Lock` calls guard modifications to the shared `players` map, preventing concurrent write issues.  
   - On Ctrl+C (`SIGINT`), `signal.signal` invokes `shutdown_server()`, closing all sockets cleanly.
