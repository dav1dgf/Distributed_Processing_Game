# üéÆ Two-Robot Arena

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)](#)

A 2D local/Online multiplayer shooter built in Unity. Two robots‚Äî**Red** vs **Blue**‚Äîface off in a compact arena, blasting each other until one remains.

## üöÄ Features

- **Local & Online Multiplayer**  
  Connect up to two clients to a headless TCP server.  
- **Responsive 2D Controls**  
  - **Red**: ‚Üê/‚Üí to move, ‚Üë to go up in the ladder, O to shoot and L to jump
  - **Blue**: A/D to move, W to go up in the ladder, Q to shoot  and Spacebar to jump
- **Special blocks & Mechanics**  
  - Ladder that can be used to reach higher locations
  - Instant-kill spikes in the lower arena void
- **Headless Server**  
  Lightweight Python implementation for server and client

## üõ†Ô∏è Concurrent Programming Methods

Below is an overview of the primary concurrency techniques and APIs used in this project:

| Context     | Language / API                 | Purpose                                                                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Client**  | **C# `async` / `await`**       | - Perform non-blocking network I/O (`ConnectAsync`, `ReadAsync`)                              |
|             | **C# `Task.Delay()`**             | - Retry logic for reconnecting every 500 ms without freezing the main game loop               |
|             | **C# `Queue<string>`**            | - Buffer incoming messages safely for processing on Unity‚Äôs main thread                       |
|             | **C# `OnApplicationQuit()`**      | - Gracefully close sockets/streams when the application exits                                |
| **Server**  | **Python `threading.Thread`**  | - Handle each client connection in its own parallel thread                                   |
|             | **Python `threading.Lock`**    | - Protect shared data structures (`players` dict) from race conditions                       |
|             | **Python `threading.Barrier`** | - Synchronize both player threads at key phases (assignment, game start, turn transitions)   |
|             | **Python `socket.recv/send`**| - Perform network I/O on worker threads without impacting other threads                      |
|             | **Python `signal.signal(SIGINT,‚Ä¶)`**  | - Catch Ctrl+C to trigger a clean, orderly server shutdown                                   |

### How it works in practice

1. **Unity Client**  
   - `Start()` is marked `async` and uses `await` to connect and then listens for server messages with `await stream.ReadAsync()`.  
   - All network calls are non-blocking, so Unity‚Äôs Update loop remains smooth and unblocked.

2. **Python Server**  
- **Connections**: The server accepts up to 2 players. Each player runs in a separate thread.
- **Synchronization**: `threading.Barrier` ensures that:
  - Both players start the game at the same time.
  - Turns are taken alternately and in sync.
- **Communication Protocol**: All messages are sent as newline-delimited JSON over TCP:
  - `ASSIGN`: assigns a unique `player_id`.
  - `START`: notifies both players to begin.
  - `DATA`: contains a player's position and the opponent's health.
  - `TURN`: informs a player it‚Äôs their turn.
  - `WINNER`: indicates the winning player.
  - `DISCONNECT`: sent when the server shuts down.
- **Validation**: The server discards any `DATA` message with:
  - X position outside [-20, 20]
  - Y position outside [-3, 3]
  - Health less than 0
- **Shutdown**:
  - If a player sends a `WINNER` message, the game ends.
